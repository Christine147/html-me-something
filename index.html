    <p>One of my favorite places to get away from it all and just relax is my sister's cottage in Cedar, MI.
    <br> From St. Louis, it's an approximately 11 hours drive.  Even though it is a long time to be in a car, 
    <br>the drive is definitely worth it!  The cottage is built into a hillside which overlooks Little Traverse Lake
    in the distance <br> and further out - spectacular views of Lake Michigan, the islands of North and South Manitou
    and the North Manitou Shoal Lighthouse.

    <p>Inside the house is warm and inviting with a stone fireplace, vaulted ceilings and windows that go all the way up!</p>

      <p>Sitting on the back deck enjoying the evening after spending the day on the beach, shopping in the nearby town of
      <br>Glen Arbor, visiting one of the local wineries or dining at one of the area restaurants is a great way to end the day.

      <p>The beaches are lined with fairly small strips of sand; perfect for getting some sun or reading a book or just looking
        <br>out at the waves lapping against the shore.  In regards to the shorline; the sand quickly gives way to rocks and stones.
        <br>There are very unique and interesting stones to look/hunt for when at the beach.  They called Petoskey Stones.  
        <br>(They remind me of turtle or dinosaur eggs for some reason).
