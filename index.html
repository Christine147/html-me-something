    <p>One of my favorite places to getwawy from it all and just relax is my sister's cottage in Cedar, MI.
      From St. Louis, it's an approximately 11 hours drive.  Even though it is a long time to be in a car, the 
      drive is definitely worth it!  The cottage is built into a hillside which overlooks Little Traverse Lake
      in the distance and further out - spectacular views of Lake Michigan, the islands of North and South Manitou
      and the North Manitou Shoal Lighthouse.

    <p>Sitting on the back deck enjoying the evening after spending the day on the beach, shopping in the nearby town of 
      Glen Arbor, visiting one of the local wineries or dining at one of the areas local restaurants is a great way to end the day.

    <p>The beaches are lined with fairly small strips of sand; perfect for getting some sun or reading a book or just looking
      out at the waves laping against the shore.  In regards to the shorline; the sand quickly gives way to rocks and stones.
      There are very unique and interesting stone to hunt for when at the beach.  It is called a Petoskey Stone.  (They remind
      me of turtle or dinosaur eggs for some reason).
